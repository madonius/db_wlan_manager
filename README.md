# Deutsche Bahn Wlan Manager

This program will monitor your wireless, 
and keep you logged into the different wlans of the DB 


## What's working?
- Keeps you logged in
- Keeping track of your spent data.
Wifis:
  - WIFIOnICE/WIFI@DB (ICE-Wlan National?)
  - DBLounge (Lounge im Bahnhof)
  - CDWifi (Wifi in Czech-Trains)
  - Wifi@DB (Sammel-Wlan verschiedener Icomera-User)
    - not yet implemented
    - 


## What's not yet working?
- International/some ICEs have a JSON-API for quota. 
I did not ride enough in those... 
- "Free @Bahnhofs Wlan"-Ding?

## How do you use it?
Start with: 

``` bash
python3 manager.py [ssid]
```
  
Use the `-b` flag for batch mode, which means it only tries to log you in and terminate.
It will check the SSID automatically via `Ã¬w`, but it can be fixed via an argument.

### Network-Manager
To use it with *network-manager*, go to the *network-manager* directory and `sudo ./install.sh`
If you connect with *network-manager* to a DB wifi, the tool will start in the background automatically and log the output to `/var/log/dbwifi`.

## Dependencies
- python3-dnspython
- python3-bs4 (beautifulsoup)

### Install Dependencies on Ubuntu
``` bash
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-bs4 python3-dnspython
```
